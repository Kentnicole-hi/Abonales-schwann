1. Project Title
   “Guess The Number”
2. What is the purpose of your project? Tell about your project?
    My game is all about guessing a number by giving hints each time your answer is wrong and the purpose of this is to entertain some kids or even adults.
3. How your program works? Explain how to run your program?
  The game starts if you type a number. IF you type a number that is higher than the decided number that your going to guess then there
  will be a hint that your guessed number is to high and you need to decrease your number same as if your hint said that it is to low so you neeed
  to increase your number until you get the number that it is being guessed. You have unlimited attempts btw.
